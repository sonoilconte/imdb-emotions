* Roll your own vdom with lenses

In a world of javascript fatigue, almost every developer
yearns to build one more framework.

But our framework is better! It uses lenses! Kinda.

- Implement your own component library that uses your own virtual dom
- Virtual dom implementation should take advantage of lenses
- For our purposes, lenses should have 2 functions of the form

~(set) s: Lens -> VDom -> VDom -> VDom~

~(view) v: Lens -> VDom -> VDom~

With your /usual/ axioms:

~s(L, s(L, D, X), Y) = Y~

~v(L, s(L, D, X)) = X~

~s(L, v(L, D), X) = D~

Note that VDom type repeats since a view over VDom is a VDom. Feel
free to differentiate between the types if it makes things easier.

Feel free to implement component however you like.

Test your microframework by implementing a simple list that takes
advantage of virtual dom updates.
