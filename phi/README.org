* Data processing pipeline

Pick two APIs from https://rapidapi.com/, one that produces text
content and the other one that consumes it. One example is, Reddit API
and Yoda Translator API.

Design the following:

- Another API that is a composition of the ones you've chosen

- As a bonus, simulate (if needed) different rate limits
  on the APIs you've chosen and design an efficient pipeline
  that continuously processes the data via composition of the
  two APIs.

** Solution

I have provided a solution that stiches together two APIs-
1. [[https://rapidapi.com/imdb/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative][Movie Database (IMDB Alternative)]]
2. [[https://rapidapi.com/twinword/api/emotion-analysis][Emotion Analysis]]

The bottleneck library is used to limit the rate of outgoing requests to the vendor APIs.

To run API tests, make sure Mocha is installed, and run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
npm test
#+END_SRC
