* Data processing pipeline

Pick two APIs from https://rapidapi.com/, one that produces text
content and the other one that consumes it. One example is, Reddit API
and Yoda Translator API.

Design the following:

- Another API that is a composition of the ones you've chosen

- As a bonus, simulate (if needed) different rate limits
  on the APIs you've chosen and design an efficient pipeline
  that continuously processes the data via composition of the
  two APIs.
